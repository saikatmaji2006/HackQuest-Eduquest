P.S: AI-Powered Renewable Energy Forecasting (By NTPC)
Background:
 Renewable energy sources like solar and wind are highly unpredictable due to their 
dependence on weather conditions. This unpredictability can cause fluctuations in energy 
generation, leading to challenges in balancing power supply and demand. Effective 
forecasting is crucial for energy grid stability, reducing reliance on fossil fuel-based backup 
power.
 Problem Statement:
 Develop a web-based AI-powered forecasting system that predicts solar and wind energy 
generation using historical weather data such as sunlight intensity, wind speed, and 
temperature. The system should provide real-time insights to energy companies, grid 
operators, and businesses, helping them optimize energy planning, reduce power 
shortages, and improve sustainability.
 Expected Features
 Web Dashboard: A user-friendly interface displaying energy generation forecasts with 
interactive charts and analytics
 AI-Powered Predictions: Uses past weather patterns and machine learning models to 
predict future solar and wind energy output
 Real-Time Data Integration: Fetches live weather data from APIs for continuous updates
 Geographical Adaptability: Supports different locations by customizing predictions 
based on local weather conditions
 Accuracy Optimization: Reduces the gap between forecasted and actual power 
generation using advanced models and error correction techniques
 API for Integration: Allows energy companies to integrate forecasts into their existing 
energy managementÂ systems.
